# TitanicSurvival

This repository has been created as a course project in the Developing Data Products course by Coursera
The idea was to develop a very simple R Shiny App to predict, the chances of surviving the Titanic disaster based on a series of evaluations on values present in the R dataset "Titanic".

The App is deployed on the Shiny App Server at the url:
https://irek978.shinyapps.io/TitanicSurvival
